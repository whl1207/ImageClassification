## Key Features

1. **Image Upload and Preprocessing**
   - Supports uploading custom image datasets.
   - Provides image preprocessing functions (e.g., resizing, normalization, data augmentation).

2. **Model Training**
   - Allows users to train custom models.
   - Offers multiple pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet) for selection.
   - Supports hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, batch size, epochs).

3. **Classification Inference**
   - Enables real-time image classification.
   - Displays confidence scores for classification results.

4. **Model Export and Import**
   - Supports exporting trained models in TensorFlow.js format.
   - Allows importing pre-trained models for inference or further training.

5. **Interactive Interface and Visualization**
   - Provides a user-friendly interface (UI).
   - Visualizes training progress with real-time loss and accuracy curves.
